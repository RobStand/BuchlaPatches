# Keen Association 268e video series
Welcome to the series of videos about Keen Association Graphic Waveform Generator Model 268e in the Buchla format. In the videos in this series on the 268e, I'll go over the module's user interface and talk about its high-level features. I'll explain how it works in depth and show you how you can patch it in interesting ways. And of course, I'll include lots of sound demos. So let's get started.


## Overview
The 268e is a fantastic module that fits very well in the Buchla paradigm. It follows the Buchla standard with inputs on the bottom and outputs on the top. With four oscillators, lots of CV inputs and outputs, amplitude- and frequency-modulation, and firmware updates that add capabilities, the 268e is a very powerful module for Buchla instruments of all sizes. And it's an e-series module, so you can store all of the settings in a preset.

The 268e has four digital oscillators, each of which has CV inputs for modulation and pitch, and an audio input for modulation. Each oscillator has a a pair of individual audio outputs. There is an "all" output that unisons the four oscillators.

The virtual tape logger is the unique and defining feature of this module. Imagine it as a tape flowing through the module at a defined speed, and as you input control voltages, they are recorded, or written, onto the tape. As the CV is written on the virtual tape, control voltages are rendered as a waveform, which you can see the in the window. As the virtual tape moves through the window, the waveform is output as audio.

The virtual tape logger operates based on the algorithm you select, the speed of the tape, and the CV you input.

There are two ways get CV into the virtual tape logger: the manual knob and the external inputs.

The manual knob is a potentiometer that moves a virtual stylus up and down the virtual tape. As the tape moves through the window, the stylus draws the waveform. More on that in the next video.

The external CV input accepts CV of 0-10v and writes the CV to the logger tape. A pulse is generated each time the direction of the control voltage changes. The violet CV output is a differential function that sends a voltage relative to the CV input: The faster the external input, the higher the voltage at the df output. There are also individual inputs for controlling the virtual tape for each oscillator.

The speed knob controls the rate of the virtual tape, from slow to fast. The speed of the tape affects the waveform that is rendered on the tape by modulating the amplitude. Faster speed makes for sharper changes in amplitude, and slower speed smooths it out. There's a control voltage input and attenuverter for externally modulating the speed.

The steady button behaves differently based on the selected algorithm. In continuous mode, it freezes the virtual tape until it is pressed again or an external pulse is recevied. In m'detector mode, it does an S+H on the active input and fills the tape with a constant value that results in a horizontal line. There is an orange pulse input that can be used to turn steady on and off.

### Control input
The control and mouldation inputs section provides pitch, modulation input, and control of the virtual tape for each oscillator. Send pitch to the black CV inputs. Use The tinijax inputs for frequency and amplitude modulation with audio rate CV. With the gray inputs, you can use CV to "draw" the waveform on the virtual logger for each oscillator independently. You can also use the gray inputs for CV modulation of frequency and amplitude modulation.

### Settings
In the settings section, you can set the base pitch for all four oscillators, in a range from 13.75 to 3520, and it includes fine tune adjustment.  THe mod bus handle knob activates the configuration view for the module.

SO that's it for the quick overview of the Graphic Waveform Generator MOdel 268e. In part 2, we'll get a deep dive into the amazing capabilities of this module. Thanks for watching.
