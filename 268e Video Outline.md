# Keen Association 268e video series
Welcome to the series of videos about Keen Association Graphic Waveform Generator Model 268e in the Buchla format.

## Overview
The 268e is a fantastic module that fits very well in the Buchla paradigm. The number "four" is a common theme of Buchla modules, and the 268e is no exception. With four digital oscillators, there are four pairs of individual outs, as well as an "all" output that unisons the four oscillators.

The virtual tape logger is the unique and defining feature of this module. Imagine it as a tape flowing through the module at a set speed, and as you input control voltages, they are recorded, or written, onto the tape. As the CV is written on the virtual tape, control voltages are rendered as a waveform, which you can see the in the window. As the virtual tape moves through the module, the waveform is output as audio.

You can control the speed of the virtual tape, input control voltages in different ways, modulate the waveforms including AM and FM, get useful outputs like pulses, CV, and audio, and control pitch of each oscillators sepaately. And as an e-series module, you can store the settings in a preset.

In this video, I will quickly go over the module's user interface and talk about its high-level features.

In the rest of the videos in this series, I'll explain how the virtual tape logger works in depth and go deeper into the modulation and control of the individual oscillators. And of course, I'll include lots of sound demos.

## UI

Let's begin our tour of the 268e with the virtual tape logger section. The virtual tape logger operates based on the algorithm you select, the speed of the tape, and the CV you input.

The virtual tape logger operates based on the algorithm you select. The algorithm defines how the virtual tape will behave on input of CV. There are two algorithms, Continuous and m'detector, which can be selected with the yellow Algorithm button.

The speed knob controls the rate of the virtual tape, from slow to fast. The speed of the tape greatly affects the waveform that is rendered on the tape. There's a control voltage input and attenuverter for externally modulating the speed.

There are two ways get CV into the virtual tape logger: the manual knob and the external inputs.

The manual knob is a potentiometer that moves a virtual stylus up and down the virtual tape, relative to the algorithm you've selected.

The external CV input accepts CV of 0-10v and writes the CV to the logger tape. A pulse is generated each time the direction of the control voltage changes. The violet CV output is a differential function that sends a voltage relative to the CV input: The faster the external input, the higher the voltage at the df output. There are also independent external inputs for each oscillator.

The steady button behaves differently based on the selected algorithm. In continuous mode, it freezes the virtual tape until it is pressed again or an external pulse is recevied. In m'detector mode, it does an S+H on the active input and filles the tape with a constant value that results in a horizontal line. There is an orange pulse input that can be used to turn steady on and off.

### Control input
The control and mouldation inputs section provides pitch, modulation input, and control of the virtual tape for each oscillator. Send pitch to the black CV inputs. Use The tinijax inputs for frequency and amplitude modulation with audio rate CV. Send CV to the gray inputs to "draw" the waveform on the virtual logger for each oscillator independently.

### Settings
In the settings section, you can set the base pitch for the oscillators, in a range from x to y, and it includes fine tune adjustment.  THe mod bus handle knob activates the configuration view for the module. And as an e-series module, the knob positions and settings can be saved in a preset.

SO that's it for the quick overview of the Graphic Waveform Generator MOdel 268e. In part 2, we'll get a deep dive into the amazing capabilities of this module. Thanks for watching.
